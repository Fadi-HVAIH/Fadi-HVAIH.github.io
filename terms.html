        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing and using this website (fadiopgenorth.com), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this site. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the site following any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Nature of Content</h2>
        <p>All content on this site — including blog posts, service descriptions, portfolio items, and any other written or visual material — is provided for general informational purposes only.</p>
        <p><strong>Nothing on this site constitutes professional advice.</strong> Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content is not accounting advice, tax advice, or audit guidance, even though the site owner holds a CPA license.</li>
          <li>Content is not legal advice, financial planning advice, or investment advice.</li>
          <li>Content does not create a CPA-client relationship, attorney-client relationship, or any other professional services relationship.</li>
          <li>Service descriptions on this site describe consulting capabilities and are not offers to perform licensed professional services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any engagement for professional services requires a separate, signed agreement with explicitly defined scope, terms, and deliverables. No professional services relationship exists unless and until such an agreement is fully executed by both parties.</p>

        <h2>3. CPA Disclaimer and Regulatory Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Fadi Opgenorth holds a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license in the state of Oregon (License #15395). The existence of this license does not mean that any content on this website, any communication through this website, or any interaction initiated through this website constitutes the practice of public accounting or the rendering of professional accounting services.</p>
        <p>Professional accounting services — including but not limited to auditing, attestation, tax preparation, tax advisory, and financial statement compilation or review — are only provided under separate engagement agreements with clearly defined scope and terms. This website is a marketing and informational platform, not a vehicle for delivering licensed professional services.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the operator of this site expressly disclaims any representation, warranty, or implication — whether arising from the use of the CPA designation, the content of this site, or any communication initiated through this site — that the operator is authorized to perform, offering to perform, or holding out to perform public accountancy or attestation services as part of, or in connection with, the business conducted through this website. The use of the CPA designation on this site is solely to indicate the professional background and qualifications of the operator as permitted under OAR 801-030-0005(5)(a) and does not indicate authorization to perform public accountancy or attestation services through this business or occupation.</p>
        <p>No CPA-client relationship, accountant-client relationship, or any other professional services relationship is created by: visiting this website, reading any content on this website, submitting any form on this website, subscribing to the newsletter, scheduling or attending any call booked through this website, or any other interaction with this website or its operator through channels provided on this website.</p>

        <h2>4. No Guarantees or Warranties</h2>
        <p>All content, services descriptions, and materials on this site are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implied warranties of merchantability</li>
          <li>Fitness for a particular purpose</li>
          <li>Non-infringement</li>
          <li>Accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Claims regarding efficiency gains, time savings, or operational improvements described on this site (e.g., percentage reductions in reporting time, workflow automation outcomes) represent goals, projections, or results achieved in specific contexts. They are not guarantees of future performance and should not be relied upon as such. Actual results will vary based on your organization's systems, data, processes, and circumstances.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
        <p>(a) Fadi Opgenorth, his affiliates, and any associated entities (including Happy Valley AI Holdings) shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of this website, reliance on any content, or interactions with any third-party services linked from this site.</p>
