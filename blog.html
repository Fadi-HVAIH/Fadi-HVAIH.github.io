        <div class="post-meta">February 2026</div>
        <p>If you manage federal awards, you've done this: opened a spreadsheet, pulled up SAM.gov in another tab, navigated to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse in a third, and started piecing together a risk assessment for a subrecipient you've worked with for years. Most automation vendors have never actually performed one.</p>
        <p>This post includes an interactive 11-point checklist to evaluate whether your vendor covers the regulatory requirements of 2 CFR 200.332 — and whether the person building it understands why those requirements exist.</p>

        <h2>Why Your AI Finance Implementation Needs a CPA, Not Just an Engineer</h2>
        <div class="post-meta">February 2026</div>

        <p>Every week, another company announces an AI tool for financial operations. Automated reconciliation. AI-powered reporting. Intelligent compliance monitoring.</p>

        <p>Most of them are built by engineers who have never reconciled a bank statement.</p>

        <p>That's not a knock on engineers — they're brilliant at building systems. But financial operations automation in regulated environments isn't just a technical problem. It's a compliance problem, a workflow problem, and an organizational change problem wrapped in a technical shell.</p>

        <p>Here's what I mean:</p>

        <p>An engineer sees a monthly close process and thinks: "I can automate these 47 steps." A CPA who has done those 47 steps sees: "Steps 12, 23, and 41 require judgment calls that depend on context the system doesn't have. Step 31 has an audit trail requirement that most automation tools don't preserve. And step 38 is only done that way because the controller who set it up in 2014 didn't know about the ASC 842 update."</p>

        <p>The best AI finance implementations happen when someone who deeply understands the domain designs the system, and engineers build it. When you skip the domain expertise, you get beautiful automation that produces wrong numbers confidently.</p>

        <p>I spent 15 years being the person who caught those wrong numbers manually. Now I build systems that get them right the first time — because I know where the landmines are before we start automating.</p>

        <p>If your organization is exploring AI for financial operations, ask yourself: Does the person designing this system know the difference between a direct cost and an indirect cost? Can they explain 2 CFR 200.413 from memory? Have they ever sat across from a single auditor?</p>

        <p>If not, you might be automating the wrong things. Or automating the right things the wrong way.</p>

        <p>The technology isn't the hard part. Understanding what to automate — and what not to — is.</p>
